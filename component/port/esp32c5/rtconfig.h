 *
 * The C5 is the C6's CLIC sibling rather than the S31's: same single RV32IMAC
 * application core, same CLIC with hardware nesting (soc_caps.h defines both
 * SOC_INT_CLIC_SUPPORTED and SOC_INT_HW_NESTED_SUPPORTED), but a standard CLIC
 * (INTTHRESH_STANDARD, mintthresh CSR) instead of the S31's vendor CSRs, and a
 * 48 MHz crystal (measured: esptool reports "Crystal frequency: 48MHz").
 *
 * Keep common settings aligned with port/esp32c6/rtconfig.h.
