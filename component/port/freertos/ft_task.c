/*
 * Tasks on RT-Thread.
 *
 * The mapping is mostly mechanical, with three traps:
 *
 * 1. Priorities run in opposite directions. FreeRTOS counts up (higher value =
 *    more important), RT-Thread counts down. Both conversions live in
 *    ft_prio_to_rt()/ft_prio_to_ft() so the sign can never be flipped in one
 *    place and not another.
 *
 * 2. Stack sizes. FreeRTOS documents xTaskCreate's depth in words, but IDF's
 *    RISC-V port defines StackType_t as uint8_t, so the unit here is a byte and
 *    rt_thread_create wants bytes too - the conversion factor is
 *    FT_STACK_UNIT_BYTES (1). Getting this from the documentation instead of
 *    from portmacro.h gives a task four times the stack it asked for, which is
 *    quiet and wasteful rather than fatal, and that is exactly why it survives
 *    review.
 *
 * 3. rt_thread_control(RT_THREAD_CTRL_CHANGE_PRIORITY) dereferences its
 *    argument as a pointer to rt_uint8_t (src/thread.c:845), so the value has
 *    to be passed by address, not cast to void *.
 *
 * Thread local storage has no RT-Thread equivalent, so a small fixed side table
 * keyed by thread pointer stands in. configNUM_THREAD_LOCAL_STORAGE_POINTERS is
 * 2 in this configuration (CONFIG_FREERTOS_THREAD_LOCAL_STORAGE_POINTERS * 2),
 * and the table is sized well past any plausible task count; a thread that does
 * not fit simply gets NULL back rather than corrupting someone else's slot.
